## About The Project

This is a short console app written as an exercise given in de udemy course C# Intermediate by Mosh Hamedani.
<br/>
It is a simple stopwatch app with a short test that prints to the console.
<br/>
<br/>
I wrote all of the exercises for this course using the TDD approach of writing tests first and then production code.
The tests are written using xUnit and Fluent Assertions.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Mosh Hamedani for making a comprehensive and easy to follow course. :star:

A list of commonly used resources that I found helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
The code was written in Visual Studio.<br/>
The test coverage was measured with JetBrains dotCover.

* [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019)
* [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp)
* [xUnit](https://xunit.net)
* [Fluent Assertions](https://fluentassertions.com/)
* [dotCover](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotcover/)

### Specifications
The given specifications were:

* Design a class called Stopwatch. The job of this class is to simulate a stopwatch. It should provide two methods: Start and Stop. We call the start method first, and the stop method next. Then we ask the stopwatch about the duration between start and stop. Duration should be a value in TimeSpan. Display the duration on the console.

* We should also be able to use a stopwatch multiple times. So we may start and stop it and then start and stop it again. Make sure the duration value each time is calculated properly.

* We should not be able to start a stopwatch twice in a row (because that may overwrite the initial start time). So the class should throw an InvalidOperationException if its started twice.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Visual Studio needs to be installed along with the dotnet core runtime and SDK
All can be installed by the Visual Studio installer.

* The installer can be found on this page 
```sh
[Visual Studio documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019)
```

### Installation

1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to install the files
3. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mpbmpb/stopwatch.git
```
3. go to the stopwatch directory
```sh
cd stopwatch
```
4. run the app from the terminal
```
dotnet run
```
5. or find the stopwatch.sln file in your explorer and double click it.
   Visual Studio should take it from there.
